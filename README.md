OCR- Optical Text Recognition

This feature is used to recognise text from an image. This feature is very useful when you have to copy text from an image. For your business related works, if you have to write something manually from any image, then you can use this feature to recognize and get all the text from the image. It may not be accurate always. But you can always correct your mistakes. It is better to correct some mistakes rather than writing the whole document manually.

The API used here is in app/build.gradle file which uses Google Vision API to recognize the text. The line "implementation 'com.google.android.gms:play-services-vision:20.1.0'" helps the code to do so...

PERSONAL RECOMMENDATION:
This feature works perfectly on Digital text images... But not so perfect on Handwriting recognition. As, it will require AI to do so...
